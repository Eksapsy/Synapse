# Synapse

This is an alpha stage neural network system with the aim to make machin learning accessible to developers in a more inuitive way than that seen in similar libraries - without the developer needing to know how neural networks work, only what they want to accomplish. 

Additionally Synpase will soon feature GPU accelerated processing support. That, along side its multi threaded design, will make the system a powerful competitor in the market of JS based machine learning solutions.
